## 📖 Overview

This project explores the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to autonomous racing. Specifically, it implements a Q-Learning agent designed to control a Formula 1 car within a custom 2D simulation environment built with Pygame. The goal is to train an AI driver that can navigate a race track efficiently, avoid obstacles, and optimize its lap times through trial and error, demonstrating the principles of state-action value learning.

This project is ideal for students and researchers interested in:
*   Understanding the practical implementation of Q-Learning.
*   Exploring agent-environment interaction in a game-like simulation.
*   Developing basic autonomous driving capabilities using machine learning.

## ✨ Features

-   **2D F1 Racing Simulation:** A custom-built Pygame environment for simulating car movement, track physics, and sensor input.
-   **Q-Learning Agent:** Implementation of a Q-Learning algorithm for the AI car to learn optimal driving policies.
-   **Modular Design:** Separate components for car physics (`car.py`), track definition (`track.py`), environment logic (`environment.py`), and the Q-learning algorithm (`q_learning_agent.py`).
-   **Configurable Parameters:** Easily adjust reinforcement learning hyperparameters and simulation settings via `config.py`.
-   **Sensor System:** The F1 car is equipped with a sensor system (`sensor.py`) to perceive its immediate surroundings and gather state information for the RL agent.
-   **Environment Testing:** Basic unit tests for critical environment functionalities (`test_env.py`) to ensure simulation correctness.
-   **Model Persistence:** Support for saving and loading trained Q-tables or neural network models (implied by `models/` directory).

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have:
-   **Python 3.8+** installed on your system.
    
### 1. Set Up Environment
 
```bash
# Create a Python 3.10 virtual environment
py -3.10 -m venv rl_env
 
# Activate it
rl_env\Scripts\activate        # Windows
source rl_env/bin/activate     # macOS / Linux
 
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
 
### 2. Verify Everything Works
 
```bash
python test_env.py
```
 
You'll see 10 steps of environment interaction with reward values and Q-table growth. If it runs without errors, you're good to go.
 
## 🚀 Usage
 
### Manual Mode — Drive It Yourself
 
```bash
python main.py
```
 
| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑` | Accelerate |
| `↓` | Brake |
| `← →` | Turn |
| `R` | Reset position |
 
### Training — Let the AI Learn
 
```bash
python train.py
```
 
Runs **2,000 episodes** in headless mode (no rendering = maximum speed). The agent explores the track, crashes a lot, and gradually figures out what it's doing.
 
- Saves a checkpoint every **100 episodes** → `models/q_table_ep{N}.pkl`
- Automatically keeps the **best model** ever → `models/q_table_best.pkl`
- Full training log → `logs/training_log.csv`
### Evaluation — Watch It Drive
 
```bash
python evaluate.py
```
 
Loads the best saved model and runs **5 visual episodes** with ε = 0 (pure exploitation, zero randomness). Watch what 2000 episodes of suffering produces.
 
Press `Q` to quit.
 
### The Reward Function
 
This is where the *real* design happens. The agent doesn't know what "driving" means — it only knows numbers. These numbers shape everything:
 
```
🏁 Pass a checkpoint      →  +50    (the main objective)
⚡ Moving fast forward    →  +5     (alive + forward bonus)
🐢 Moving slow            →  -0.5   (nudge to keep moving)
🔙 Going backwards        →  -2     (strong discouragement)
💥 Hitting a wall         →  -50    (terminal punishment)
```
 
> **Design note:** The +50 checkpoint reward is intentionally large. Without it, the agent learns to drive in circles avoiding walls — technically alive, strategically useless.
 
### Q-Learning Update Rule
 
At every step, the Q-table is updated via the Bellman equation:
 
```
Q(s, a)  ←  Q(s, a) + α · [ r + γ · max Q(s', a') − Q(s, a) ]
                             ↑           ↑
                          reward    discounted future value
```
 
## ⚙️ Configuration
 
Everything is tunable in `config.py`:
 
```python
# Car Physics
CAR_SPEED_MAX    = 6       # Max speed (px/frame)
CAR_ACCELERATION = 0.3     # Acceleration per frame
CAR_FRICTION     = 0.05    # Natural deceleration
 
# Sensors
SENSOR_COUNT     = 5
SENSOR_MAX_RANGE = 150     # Vision range (px)
SENSOR_ANGLES    = [-60, -30, 0, 30, 60]
 
# Q-Learning
LEARNING_RATE    = 0.1
GAMMA            = 0.95    # Future reward discount
EPSILON_DECAY    = 0.998   # Exploration decay per episode
 
# Training
MAX_EPISODES     = 2000
SAVE_INTERVAL    = 100
```
